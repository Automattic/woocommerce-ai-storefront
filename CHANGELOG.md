## Unreleased

### Features

- **Discovery tab — boundary note for general-purpose SEO crawlers.** Closes #268.
  - The "Allowed AI agents" section now includes a one-line helper text clarifying that this list controls AI-specific crawlers (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.).
  - Notes that general-purpose search engines (Google, Bing, Yandex, etc.) are managed by WordPress core and any installed SEO plugin — not by this plugin.
  - Resolves the "I don't see Googlebot here — does that mean I haven't allowed it?" confusion for merchants without an SEO plugin.

- **Expanded AI crawler allow-list.** Added four AI agents to the canonical crawler list:
  - `YouBot` (You.com) — live retrieval + training. Default-on, `LIVE_BROWSING_AGENTS` general subgroup. Brand: "You" (matches the `you.com` canonical entry in `WC_AI_Storefront_UCP_Agent_Header::KNOWN_AGENT_HOSTS`, so UA-token traffic and UCP-attributed traffic from You.com roll up under one brand).
  - `Mistralai-User` (Mistral) — live retrieval. Default-on, `LIVE_BROWSING_AGENTS` general subgroup, following the `-User` suffix convention used by OpenAI / Anthropic / Perplexity. Brand: "Mistral".
  - `anthropic-ai` — Anthropic's older crawler identifier still seen in real logs alongside the newer `ClaudeBot`. Default-off, `TRAINING_CRAWLERS`. Maps to the existing "Claude" brand so per-vendor stats consolidate cleanly.
  - `Diffbot` — Knowledge Graph builder licensed by several LLM vendors as training input. Default-off, `TRAINING_CRAWLERS`. Brand: "Diffbot".

  Token→brand map in `class-wc-ai-storefront-crawl-logger.php` updated; admin UI checkbox list in `endpoint-info.js` updated; existing `RobotsTest::test_ai_crawlers_is_union_of_live_training_and_test` continues to pass since the flat `AI_CRAWLERS` constant was updated in lockstep.

### Fixes

- **`/llms.txt` now announces the UCP API instead of the raw Store API.** Closes #271.
  - The "API Access" section was pointing AI agents at `/wp-json/wc/store/v1` (WooCommerce's raw Store API), which bypasses the UCP layer's agent fingerprinting, rate limiting, and access control.
  - Now announces `/wp-json/wc/ucp/v1` (the plugin's purpose-built UCP REST surface) as the AI-agent front door, paired with the existing `/.well-known/ucp` Commerce Protocol Manifest.
  - Stale comment in the generator that claimed the plugin "does NOT expose its own authenticated API" updated to describe the actual UCP-on-top-of-Store-API architecture.
  - Pinned test renamed from `test_api_access_section_points_to_store_api_and_ucp` to `test_api_access_section_points_to_ucp_api_and_manifest`; new regression guard asserts `wc/store/v1` does NOT appear in the output so a future change can't quietly re-announce it.

- **Discovery tab — relabel "UCP API hits" to "UCP manifest hits".** The card was summing `ENDPOINT_UCP` events, which only fire when an agent reads the static `/.well-known/ucp` manifest — not when it calls the UCP REST surface (`catalog/search`, `catalog/lookup`). Those calls are recorded under `ENDPOINT_STORE_API_*` and roll up into the "Catalog queries" card. The previous label suggested API traffic was being counted, which led merchants to read a 0 there as "no UCP API activity" when it really meant "no fresh manifest fetches". The label now matches what the field counts, parallel to the adjacent "llms.txt hits" card. Underlying API field name (`ucp_hits`) and recording behavior are unchanged.

### Refactors

- **`robots.txt` opt-in block now uses a single grouped rule (RFC 9309 §2.2.1).** Pre-0.8.8 the plugin emitted a separate `User-agent:` block with a duplicated 9-line Allow/Disallow body per allowed bot, producing ~200 lines on a default install with ~20 default-on crawlers. The opt-in path now emits all allowed `User-agent:` lines first, followed by a single shared rule body — same shape the opt-out block (`Disallow: /` for unchecked bots) has used since 1.6.1. Output drops to ~30 lines without changing the rules any crawler sees. Closes #267.

### Tests

- New `test_opt_in_block_uses_grouped_user_agent_form` pinning the consolidated shape: each allowed bot appears as its own `User-agent:` line, and the Allow rules appear exactly once for the whole group. The pre-existing `test_allows_ucp_rest_endpoint_for_every_crawler` was renamed to `test_allows_ucp_rest_endpoint_in_consolidated_block` and its assertion updated from "once per crawler" to "exactly once for the group".
